Currently Loop doesn't have an installer. This results in having to add the executable to your path manually.

:::

Loop is a cross-platform bytecode compiled language. To run a Loop application (or use it's REPL) you will need to download it's executable.

1. You can download Loop from [here](https://github.com/looplanguage/loop/releases/latest)
2. Once you have downloaded Loop you will need to extract it
3. Now you can either run the executable directly or
4. Add it to your path so you can run `./loop` from everywhere

Now you can get to the next step, [creating your first app](first-app.md)
