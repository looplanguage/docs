# Creating Your First Application

1. Create a directory named as your application, we'll be using "example"
2. Now create a file named as your application as well. "example.loop"
3. Open this file in your favourite editor & write `print("Hello World!")` (without the quotes)
4. Now you can run your application:
   1. Windows: `./loop.exe example.loop`
   2. Linux: `./loop example.loop`
   3. MacOS: `./loop example.loop`
5. The result is now `Hello World`!

Congratulations!

You wrote your first Loop application. The possibilities are endless! Take a look at more examples or see more specific documentation by browsing on the left.
