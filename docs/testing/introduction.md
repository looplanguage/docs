# Introduction

Testing in software development is done to validate if a product does what it is supposed to do. With that validation you can provide the nescecary information to the stakeholders.

## Unit vs Integration tests.

Unit-testing is a way to test the smallest "unit" (Hence the name) of code. It is used to check if a small snippet of code does the right thing with a centain input.
Another type of testing that you see alot is: "Integration-testing". Integration tests check the whole system, to check if it system does what the user expects its to do.
