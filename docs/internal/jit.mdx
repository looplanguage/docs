Loop's JIT compiler is in **very** early stages. We advise **not** running your application with JIT-mode enabled (--jit) until it's thoroughly tested by our QA team.

:::

Loop features a JIT-compiler which will on-demand compile functions to native machine code, this boasts massive performance gain. Only functions will be JIT-compiled. Code in the root scope will not be jitted. Once a function is compiled once to native code it will be stored in memory for future use.

## Enabling JIT

To enable JIT in Loop you need to pass a flag to the Loop executable. How this is done depends on your operating system:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows" default>

```
loop.exe --jit <filename>.loop
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

```
loop --jit <filename>.loop
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```
loop --jit <filename>.loop
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also use the short-hand flag operator for this: `-j` instead of `--jit`.
